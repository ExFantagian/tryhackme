how to do subdomain enumeration

Tokens: 560
Subdomain enumeration is the process of identifying subdomains associated with a primary domain. This can be useful for various purposes, such as security assessments or mapping out a website's structure. Here are several methods for subdomain enumeration:
DNS Zone Transfers: If a DNS server is misconfigured, you might be able to perform a DNS zone transfer to get a list of all subdomains. This is usually done using dig or specific tools.
dig axfr domain.com @dns-server
DNS Bruteforcing: You can use a dictionary of common subdomain names and brute-force the DNS server to check for existence. Tools like dnsenum, subbrute, or dnsrecon can help automate this process.
Web Scraping: Scrape web pages, directories, and services that might list subdomains. GitHub, forums, and other platforms might have references to subdomains.
Online Services: Use online tools and services that provide subdomain enumeration, like:
VirusTotal
SecurityTrails
Spyse
Censys
Certificate Transparency Logs: Search through Certificate Transparency logs to find issued certificates for subdomains. Tools like crt.sh can be utilized to search for a specific domain.
Search Engines: Use Google dorking to find subdomains indexed by search engines. For example:
site:*.domain.com
Subdomain Enumeration Tools: Various tools can automate gathering subdomains, such as:
Amass
Sublist3r
Subfinder
Knockpy
Passive Reconnaissance: Use passive methods to collect information. Tools like PassiveTotal or intelligence platforms can provide information about subdomains without directly querying DNS servers.
APIs: Some services provide APIs that allow querying for subdomain information programmatically.
Always ensure that you have permission to conduct such enumeration, especially if it's for a domain that you do not own. Unauthorized enumeration may be considered illegal or unethical in many jurisdictions.

Subdomain enumeration is the process of finding subdomains associated with a given domain. This is often done by security professionals and ethical hackers for various purposes, including penetration testing. Here are several common methods for subdomain enumeration:
DNS Enumeration Tools: Use tools like Sublist3r, Amass, or Subfinder that automate the process of discovering subdomains by querying public DNS records, searching in search engines, and more.
Online Tools: Websites like VirusTotal, SecurityTrails, or DNSdumpster offer online services for discovering subdomains. You can enter the domain and see if they provide any listed subdomains.
Brute Forcing: This method involves guessing subdomains by using a wordlist. Tools like ffuf or Gobuster can be employed for this purpose. You would try common subdomain names (like www, mail, blog, etc.) against the main domain.
Certificate Transparency Logs: Tools like crt.sh allow you to search certificate transparency logs for any SSL certificates issued for subdomains of the target domain.
Search Engine Queries: Sometimes, search engines can provide results for subdomains. You can use Google search queries tailored to find specific subdomains, like using site:futurevera.thm.
Manual Checking: Sometimes simply typing in potential subdomain names into your browser can help discover active subdomains.
Always remember to get permission before performing any actions that may be considered intrusive or unauthorized on domains you do not own.
If you're looking to perform this enumeration on the specific domain https://futurevera.thm/, consider trying a couple of the above methods or tools to get started.

how to use kali tools to subdomain enumerate

Tokens: 695
To enumerate subdomains using tools available in Kali Linux, you can follow these general steps:
1. Using DNS Enumeration Tools:
Sublist3r: This is a popular subdomain enumeration tool that uses various search engines and web services to gather subdomains.
Install Sublist3r (if not installed):
sudo apt-get install sublist3r
Use Sublist3r:
sublist3r -d example.com
Gobuster: This is a directory and file brute-forcing tool that can also be used for subdomain enumeration.
Use Gobuster to enumerate subdomains:
gobuster dns -d example.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
Amass: A powerful tool for in-depth subdomain enumeration.
Install Amass (if not installed):
sudo apt-get install amass
Use Amass:
amass enum -d example.com
2. Using Online Services:
Tools like crt.sh and VirusTotal allow you to look up SSL certificates and glean subdomain information.
Example:
Go to crt.sh and search for example.com.
3. Using Passive and Active Enumeration:
Passive Enumeration involves gathering data from public sources (search engines, databases, etc.).
Active Enumeration involves making DNS queries or brute-forcing domains.
4. Example Commands:
To combine tools for comprehensive enumeration, you could run:
sublist3r -d example.com -o subdomains.txt
amass enum -d example.com -o amass_subdomains.txt
gobuster dns -d example.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dns.txt -o gobuster_subdomains.txt
5. Post-Enumeration:
After gathering subdomains, you may want to validate the live subdomains using a tool like httprobe:
cat subdomains.txt | httprobe
6. Using Nmap for Further Scanning:
After obtaining subdomains, you can conduct further scanning using Nmap:
nmap -sP subdomain.example.com
7. Refer to Documentation:
Each tool comes with its documentation and options. Always refer to them for advanced usage.
These steps should guide you through the process of subdomain enumeration using various tools in Kali Linux.
Remember to always ensure you have permission to enumerate or scan a domain to avoid legal issues.
